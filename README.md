# SynapseOS – Browser-Based AI Operating System

**SynapseOS** is an experimental project within the **HSWLP ecosystem**,  
designed as a **visual AI operating system** running directly in the browser.  

The goal is to provide a **desktop-like interface** where multiple AI assistants  
can be launched as independent windows, each specialized in different tasks  
(e.g., writing, coding, design, research).

## ✨ Vision

SynapseOS aims to reimagine how users interact with AI:  
- 🖥️ **Windowed Interface** – multiple AI agents running in parallel  
- 🔌 **Modular Design** – add or remove assistants dynamically  
- 🧠 **Task-Specific Agents** – writers, coders, planners, creative tools  
- ☁️ **Cloudflare-Native Deployment** – lightweight and globally distributed  
- 🎨 **User-Friendly UI** – drag-and-drop, resizable windows, persistent sessions  

---

## 🛠️ Planned Architecture

- **Frontend:** React (Next.js) + TailwindCSS  
- **State Management:** WebSockets + KV for sessions  
- **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers (API & agent orchestration)  
- **Database:** D1 (user profiles, agent configs)  
- **Storage:** R2 (persistent data, files)  
- **AI Layer:** Local or API-based LLM integrations (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.)

## 📅 Current Status

🚧 **Concept / Early Prototype** – SynapseOS is currently in the design stage.  
This repository serves as the foundation for experiments with UI and agent orchestration.

## 📌 Roadmap

- [ ] Core window manager (drag, resize, close)  
- [ ] AI agent integration (chat-based)  
- [ ] Multi-agent orchestration  
- [ ] Persistent sessions with KV  
- [ ] File & data storage (R2)  
- [ ] Advanced desktop-like UI features

## 🌍 Part of the HSWLP Ecosystem

SynapseOS is one of several experimental projects under the  
**HSWLP (Hybrid Service Workflow Launch Platform)** initiative.  

It complements other apps like:  
- **AikaHUB** – AI + VR community hub  
- **Yume** – music & image sharing platform  
- **HSWLP:Talk** – video conferencing system  

Together, these demonstrate the versatility of Cloudflare-native applications.
